PCsoft is where PC is programming.
Life Started from PCOS Web OS, this is an OS that i was developing in a browser and it got discontinued.
After PCOS we got some other projects, even a new Web OS called "Duckdroid",
that tries to simulate Android, it even has an official root patch.
And yeah, PCsoft is STILL ALIVE.
